// You’re mixing two concepts that look similar but operate on different layers. The confusion is common, so here’s the clean separation:

// ## 1. **Immutability is about the *value***

// A string value like `"hello"` cannot be changed **in place**.
// Once created, its internal characters are frozen.

// You cannot do:

// ```js
// "hello"[0] = "H"   // impossible
// ```

// The value itself is read-only.

// ---

// ## 2. **Reassignment is about the *variable***

// A variable is just a **pointer** to a value.
// You’re free to make the variable point somewhere else.

// ```js
// let s = "hello";  // s → "hello"
// s = "hi";         // s → "hi"
// ```

// You are *not* modifying `"hello"`.
// You’re abandoning it and pointing `s` to a new value.

// Immutability never restricts how variables behave;
// it only restricts how *the value* behaves.

// ---

// ## 3. Precise distinction

// * **Mutation**: changing the inside of an existing value.
//   Strings do **not** allow this.

// * **Reassignment**: changing what a variable refers to.
//   Variables always allow this (unless declared with `const`).

// ---

// ## 4. Analogy

// Think of a variable as a **label** stuck to an object.

// * String immutability = the object can’t be altered.
// * Reassignment = you can peel the label off and stick it onto another object.

// No contradiction.

// If you want, we can walk through how `const` interacts with this, or compare with Python/Java behavior for more clarity.
